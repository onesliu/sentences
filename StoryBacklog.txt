Story backlog

1. I need a convenient sentences input interface, may be it could capture
   screen or get them from clipboard or import from file.
2. I need an interface to review sentences continously. chinese being showed
   first and then english later. if you don't remember, it'll be revealed more times.
3. I need an alert mechanism about many of sentences being in show time.
4. I need sentences group feature, because i cann't recite so much more at one time.
5. I need remember a sentence first, then redo after 20 minutes,1 hour,4 hours,etc.
   if i don't remember it. the time interval will not be increased. The sentences
   would be shown under many other criteria.
